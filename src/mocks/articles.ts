All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p><p><br></p><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">.transition {\n -webkit-transition:all .3s ease-in-out;\n -moz-transition:all .3s ease-in-out;\n -o-transition:all .3s ease-in-out;\n transition:all .3s ease-in-out;\n}</pre><p><br></p><ol><li>this is on</li><li>this is two</li><li>this is four</li></ol><p><br></p><h2>Where does it come from?</h2><p>Contrary to<strong> popular belief, Lorem Ipsum</strong> is not simply random text.
